# If querying the user before executing `rm *' or `rm path/*',
# first wait ten seconds and ignore anything typed in that time.

# when one didn't really mean it.  The wait and query can always be
# avoided by expanding the `*' in ZLE (with tab).

# EXTENDED_HISTORY (which makes it easier to find the spot where
# we left off reading the file after it gets re-written).

# parameter.
# Note that setting or unsetting this option on the command line does not
